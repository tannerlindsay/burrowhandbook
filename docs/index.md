# Welcome to The Burrow
We are excited to welcome you for your upcoming stay and play at The Burrow! In order to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, we would like to provide you with some information to help you with your stay. Your hosts will be on-site for any questions or clarifications, and you are also welcome to reach out to them via email, text, semaphore flag, or smoke signal.

Please save this page and check it during your visit for any updates or changes. Or who knows,
maybe there will be prizes!

You will find more information about your stay in each of the sections on the left.

# The Kraken
The Burrow is also home to The Kraken, aka a "busy toddler". The Kraken is always moving, loves exploring and has surprising reach. As The Kraken is still learning about the world, they don't
always know how to stay safe. In support of this, the Burrow has installed several Kraken management
systems, known by others as "child proofing".

{: .note }
It is possible that "child proofing" is real. However we can confirm "Kraken proofing" is not real.
The best we hope for is to limit the damage of the Kraken and keep it safe.

To that end, guests will find a varity of challenges in performing ordinary tasks that they are
not accustomed to in their own homes. Things like opening doors or cabinets. Getting water or
taking out trash. In order to help guests navigate these challenges, your hosts can provide a
"Kraken Seminar" to guide you through any challenges you might encounter.

{: .highlight }
Guests do not need to brink a fork to the seminar. All necessary equipment is provided as part of your stay.

## Kraken Tips
To help keep The Kraken safe, here are a few tips that can help out:
 - Close doors that lead to bathrooms, bedrooms or any room that is not "Kraken Ready".
    The Kraken has not yet learned how to turn door knobs.
 - Keep the gates at the stairs closed when possible.
 - If you don't want your shoes to go on an adventure, do not leave them at the shoe rack.
 - The Kraken likes dogs, but is still learning to be soft and respectful. Please help us keep
    everyone safe. (See [Canine Code](https://tannerlindsay.github.io/burrowhandbook/canines/) for more details)
 - The Kraken can have a very shrill voice. Please talk to your host if you need ear protection.
 - The Kraken may sometimes have a bad smell. Speak with your hosts and they can take care of it.
 - The Kraken has been known to throw food.
