# Other Amenities
Below are a few other amenities that are available

## Basement Mini Fridge
There is a small fridge in the basement in the office.

## Piano
A piano is available, and guests are welcome to play. We do ask that any piano performances be
limited to the hours of 8am - 8pm and please be considerate of other guests.

## Smart Speakers
There are numerous smart speakers throughout the house. You can activate them by saying
"Hey Google". They can play music or provide announcements or otherwise. Woooah it's magic!

## Television
There is a television in the living room on the main floor and another in the family room in the
basement. Various streaming services are available. Live broadcast TV is not available. Please
be aware that remote controls are a favorite of toddlers, so be careful where you put them
or you may find you are suddenly watching Dino Ranch.

## WaterRower
A WaterRower rowing machine is available to guests interested in some indoor exercise.
