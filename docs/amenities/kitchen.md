# Kitchen
The Burrow is please to offer a full gourmet kitchen to all our guests. Please reveiw information
below about what is available and how to take advantage of the kitchen. If you have any questions
don't hesitate to check with your hosts.

As it is a shared space, we ask that you be considerate of other guests and help keep the space
tidy.

{: .note }
The kitchen is an especially tricky area for toddlers, so be sure to review the [Welcome](https://tannerlindsay.github.io/burrowhandbook/) page for information about about safety and "child proofing" that is used at The Burrow.

## Kitchen Stuffs
The kitchen is well stocked with all kinds of tableware, flatware, small appliances, specialty
cookware, specialty equipment and the basics. Please consult the on-site diagrams for the location
of any of these items or check with your host.

If you have dietary restrictions or a special request, please contact your hosts

## Drink Station
At the 'Prep Sink' you will find a variety of options to create your own fun drinks.

## Fridge
Guests are welcome to use the fridge, and eat anything contained therein. If you want to save
something, or are preparing a large meal some coordination may be required. The fridge is stocked
with a variety of condiments, dressings and the normal stuff. The Burrow stocks whole milk. If you
want something else, you will need to provide that.

The Fridge has a water and ice dispenser. Due to the presence of toddlers, it should usually be
locked. Holding the lock button for 3 seconds will lock and unlock the dispenser. The precisision
disensing and hot water features are not avaialable.

## Stove and Oven
The stove is a 6 burner, chef-grade gas stove. Two of the burners are designated for the built in
griddle. When using the griddle, do not turn the burners above **4**. Note that the front right
burner is very large with high output and not suited for small pans.

The oven is a combo-fuel double oven. The upper oven is great for cookies, pizza and smaller items
and baking. The lower over provides convection (bake and roast), broil, air fry and bake options. A
pizza stone is in the lower oven and can remain during any cooking or be removed if needed.

The range hood has lights and **vents to the outside**. It does a great job at catching any
smoke and steam.

The stove cannot be locked. The oven controls can be locked and unlocked activation by pressing
and holding the lock button for 3 seconds.

To address concerns about indoor air quality, we ask that you turn the hood fan onto at least low
any time the stove or oven is in use.

## Microwave
The Burrow is excited to be one of the very first locations in the world to have the newest cooking
technology called a "Microwave". This marvel of modern engineering can heat food in just a couple
minutes without toiling over the stove or waiting for the oven to preheat. Your hosts will be happy
to demonstrate how you can leverage this amazing appliance during your stay!

## Dishwasher
The dishwasher works OK. It's not terrible, but most things benefit from at least a bit of a rinse
before going in. You are welcome to put dirty dishes directly into the dishwasher throughout the day to help keep the sink clear.

The dishwasher should be started each night before bed so that it is clean in the morning, and
unloaded in the morning so it is reach for more dirty dishes.

{: highlight }
The following should not be put in the dishwasher: sharp knives, non-stick cookware, 
aluminum cooking sheets and the wok. If you are unsure, check with your hosts.

## Pantry
The pantry contains a variety of goods that guests are welcome to use. Some staples, such flour,
sugar and other baking items are in the cabinet next to the pantry.

## Grill
There is a natural gas grill on the patio outside the kitchen. It has a large, 4 burner grilling
surface, a rotisserie burner (and spit and motor) and a side burner/sear station.
