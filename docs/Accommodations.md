# Accommodations at The Burrow
Here at The Burrow, we pride ourselves on always welcoming one more. Below you will find 
information about what you can expect, as well as what has been claimed or is still available.

## Our Rooms
All rooms are provided with bed linens, pillows and plenty of blankets. If you have any 
questions or special requests, or would like to make a reservation, please contact your host.

### The Guest Room
This lovely room comes with a queen bed and mattress and is perfect for a couple. There is also
a desk and chair, side table and snack cart. The closet has space for clothes and crafting.
This room is near the basement bathroom for all your pampering needs.

### The Basement Pullout
This is not your grandma's pullout. A generous full sized pullout with a luxury foam topper,
you will think you are sleeping on an actual bed! This is in the "Family Room" so includes
a large OLED TV, fully stocked bookshelf and reading nook, giant bean bag and a rowing machine.
It also usually includes lots of social interaction, as there is no door and people have to walk
through it. Plan accordingly. This room shares a bathroom with The Guest Room.

### The Pink Room
Do you love pink? You will love this room! Pink walls and pink curtains adorn the many windows.
This room features the most windows of any of our accommodations. The bed is a lovely pink futon
that folds out to a full sized bed. The room features a selection of books and a piano. This room
is next to the powder room, with a shower available upstairs or in the basement.

### The Playroom
Want to travel back to a time when life was simpler? Stay in the playroom and relive your toddler days. This room is full of all sorts of toys that will awaken your inner child. The bed is a twin Casper mattress directly on the floor - so you can roll right out of bed and start playing - even
if it is the middle of the night. This room is next to the upstairs bathroom which features a 
bath/shower set to toddler temperatures for that refreshing start to the day.

## The Facilities

{: .new }
The Burrow was recently updated with a tankless waterheater, providing unlimited hot water for
guests. It can also power multiple showers at once so no need for scheduling and no running out!

The Burrow has 2 full baths and 1 half bath available for guests. Full baths are on the upper floor
and basement, with the half bath on the main floor. Guests are welcome to use any facility they choose.

{: .note }
The bath/shower in the upstairs bathroom is set to prevent burns to children, so does not get as
hot as the basement.

## Access
Guests can access The Burrow through two exterior doors or the garage. Access codes will be 
provided via message just prior to arrival.

### Front and Back Doors
To open, press the "logo" on the lock, then enter the code, the press the check mark.
The door will automatically re-lock after 2 minutes.

### Garage
Enter the code, then press 'Enter'. To close from the outside, just press 'Enter', no code required.


# Our Sister Location
The Burrow has a special relationship with a sister location downtown. If you are interested in
using these accommodations, please let both us and our sister know.
