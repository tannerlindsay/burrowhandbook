## At The Burrow
The following are available right at the Burrow. No need to go anywhere!

### Serious Activities
Are you having too much fun? Do you need a bit of "work" to really enjoy your time? The following
tasks are available to any interested parties.
 - Pick strawberries
   - There are strawberry bushes in the back yard that are always putting out more strawberries.
 - Weed Cleanup
   - In the backyard this year, if it is not a raspberry bush, fruit tree or in the strawberry planter
        it is a weed and can be removed. This includes blackberries, and anything already dead.
 - Back fence gate gap
   - There is a gap between the back gate and the ground. We want to use some bricks/rocks to bring
        the ground up to the bottom of the fence
   - **Note: This task may be required in order to make the backyard safe for small dogs**
 - Washing machine pan
   - Did you know washing machines leak water? Maybe not all of them, but this one does. We have
        a pan to put under it. But it's heavy and help is nice.
 - Scooping
   - You all know what word goes before that. Dogs go outside.
 - Anything else?
   - If there is something else you would like to do or help out - just ask your hosts and we are
        happy to accomodate.
