## General Guidelines
 - All owners are responsible for their dog and others should respect guidelines set for specific dogs.
 - All dogs will be provided their own safe space - usually a crate or kennel. Anyone (human and canine)
    without a valid driver's license should not be permitted to pester, poke, taunt, harass, feed or sing
    to a dog in their space.
 - All dogs must be allowed to leave a situation they are not comfortable with, and people will help make
    sure that is respected. If a dog is uncomfortable with a person or another dog, they should be able
    to move away or leave. Owners will help make sure other dogs respect this and adults will help make sure children respect this. Staying on top of this will help prevent escalation and anxiety for
    dogs and people.
 - When a toddler is in a shared/open space with dogs, dogs shall not outnumber people.
 - The goal should generally be calm, well managed situations. This may mean limiting interactions between
    some dogs and/or toddlers. If the situation is stressful or difficult, moving dogs or toddlers to
    better spaces is recommended. To this end, the following "priorities" are being established:
   - The basement will have priority for dogs always
   - The backyard will have priority for dogs always
   - The upper floor will have priority for toddlers always
   - The main floor will have priority for toddlers between 8am and 8pm
   - These are flexible based on what is happening - just communicate and be considerate. If a dog is
        headed on a walk or a toddler needs to eat a snack, we can work it out.

## Food, Water and Mealtimes
 - When everyone is eating together, the dogs should be in their own spaces. This is to help reduce
    any begging, food guarding, or toddlers who feed their dinner to dogs.
 - Some limited food dishes are available, but is recommended to bring your own.
 - If the dogs don't live together, be careful about feeding them together.
 - A water dish will be available all the time. Adults should help keep it full and toddlers away from it.

## Available Amenities
The following amenities are available either at The Burrow or nearby:
 - Crates are avaialble. They are large and can include a cushion or mattress. They will be available for
    use as a safe space, as well as a place to sleep.
 - There are multiple off-leash dog parks available. Locations and details about each park can be obtained
    from your host.
 - The neighborhood has an extensive system of trails where on-leash dogs are welcome. There are also
    trash cans and bags to dispose of waste. It is recommended you always have a bag on hand in case
    you can't find one. Neighbors have been known to post on social media when dog owners don't clean up.
